# JavaScript Calculator

 The "Javascript Calculator" project is an interactive web application designed to help developers improve their skills in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The project involves building a fully functional calculator using these three technologies.  The calculator will feature a user-friendly interface, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The project will challenge developers to implement the calculator's logic using Javascript and create an intuitive interface using HTML and CSS. This will involve developing skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS styling.

The project is suitable for beginners who have a basic understanding of Javascript, HTML, and CSS and want to develop their skills further. It is also ideal for developers who want to improve their problem-solving abilities and explore the possibilities of front-end development.

By completing this project, developers will gain hands-on experience in building interactive web applications using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This will help them develop the confidence and skills necessary to tackle more complex projects in the future.
